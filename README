CloudDB Replication Benchmark

CloudDB Replication Benchmark is a database workload generator 
based on Cloudstone/Olio(RoR) which aims of evaluating the 
performance characteristics of database replication in virtualized 
cloud environment. Using the database and different workloads of the 
Cloudstone benchmark, the project targets to experimentally assess 
the behavior of the master-slave database replication strategy on 
Amazon EC2 platforms.

In order to have the replication delay benchmark work properly, it 
is suggested to have a NOW function in microsecond resolution. A 
compiled file is included in another directory which contains all 
possible scripts and archives for automatic deployment in cloud.

The project is inspired by Cloudstone project and Apache Olio
http://radlab.cs.berkeley.edu/wiki/Projects/Cloudstone
http://incubator.apache.org/olio/

A few codes are adopted from Faban under CDDL
http://java.net/projects/faban/

This project is part of the CloudDB AutoAdmin project 
http://cdbslaautoadmin.sourceforge.net/

This directory contains the source code for the CloudDB Replication 
Benchmark workload and data generators. The directory structure is 
standard to Faban. The directories of interest (where source code 
resides) are bin, deploy and src. 

To build, create 'build.properties' from the corresponding template and 
choose a right workload from src/org/apache/olio/workload/driver/
UIDriver.java.wX0rY0, where wX0rY0 represents write/read ratio at X0:Y0, 
execute 'ant deploy.jar'. Once the faban master is started, you can
also automatically deploy the benchmark, by using 'ant deploy'.

An explanation of the directory structure follows:
- build.properties.template: This file is a template for build.properties
  that needs to exist in this directory before you can build and deploy
  the driver code.
  The faban.home property needs to be set to home directory where faban
  is installed. 
  The faban.url property needs to be set to the url of the faban master
  where the benchmark needs to be deployed.

- The bin directory contains workload specific scripts and executables.

- The deploy directory contains the run parameters (run.xml) and Xforms
  configuration (config.xhtml). 

- The src directory contains the source code and different workload 
  for the driver, dbloader and fileloader. Corresponding shell-script 
  wrappers reside in 'bin'.

- The lib directories hold standard faban content.
